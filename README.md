# Beamer Themes

## beamerthemeJLTree.sty

Yet an other tree based theme for beamer with the outline and the
running subsection displayed on the header of the slides.

This theme is also available from
http://www.ctan.org/pkg/beamerthemejltree and is part of the TeX Live
and MiKTeX distributions.

## beamerthemeJLBasic.sty

A beamer theme with very few decorations and a simple look and
feel. The running header only shows the tittle of the presentation and
not more.
